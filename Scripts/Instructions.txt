This requires a sphere prefab with the Ball script attached to it and in the scene an empty GameObject with the GameController script attached.


In the Ball class

create a Name property that defaults to "Unnamed".

Create a private Color variable

Create a constructor that logs out the name of the object.

Add a public method that sets the name of the Ball instance and logs out the name

Add a public method that sets the color of the Ball instance


In the GameController class

Create a public reference to the prefab we will be spawning

Add 3 references to the 3 instances we will spawn

Add 3 Color variables (red, blue, green) that we will set instance to 

Add 3 positions for each of the instances

In the Start method, instantiate the prefab, set the position, set the name of the instance to correspond to the color it will be and set the color.

Repeat the above for the other 2 object instances.

Compile and Test.
